- SUPERSTAR â€“ INSPIRED INNOVATION: Find yourself behind the net and catch the defence sleeping? Scoop up the puck and tuck it under the bar for a jaw-dropping Michigan.Break the goalies brain with Kucherovs no-deke deke. Score from an impossible angle with an insane between-the-legs one-timer just like Matthew Tkachuk. Shake off a pesky defender by banking the puck off the back of the net to create space, just like Sid.Each of these iconic moves created an unforgettable hockey moment; create your own in NHL 21
- IMPROVED AI HOCKET IQ: AI has been optimized to make sure that your teammates can break out on their own and hit you with a pass in stride so you can keep drivingto the net. In addition, theyll be better positioned and more open to the net for passes in the O-zone. On the other side of the puck, defensive AI will work harder to slow down the opposing team in the middle of the ice and block passing lanes when defending
- IMPROVED GOALIE CONTROL: Goaltending controls have been reworked to use the right stick for more of your movements, making user controlled goalies more fluid andtactile.IMPROVED GOALIE POSITIONING: AI goalies are smarter when it comes to positioning - theyll adjust and square up to the shooters approach angle to give themselves the best chance of making the stop
- SLIPS, BANKS AND CHIPS: NHL 21 revolutionizes neutral zone play with the addition of slips, banks and chips. Get small and slippery along the boards as you squeakby a defenders check. Bank the puck off the boards and around your opponent or use the back of the net to do the same. Or just chip the puck past a flatfooted defenseman and burn him on your way to the goal
- GAMESAVING GOALIE DESPERATION: Great goaltending is born out of calculated athleticism - being in the best position to make the stop, while having the athletic abilityto quickly shut the door on an unexpected opportunity. New desperation saves and animations mean that youre never out of it - theres always a chance to make a jaw-dropping, acrobatic stop - even against your momentum
