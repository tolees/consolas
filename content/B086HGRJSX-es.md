‚ÑπÔ∏è:

- BioShock Infinite: The Complete Edition - Private Detective Booker DeWitt has debts for the wrong people and is now forced to take an impossible job: in Columbia, a flying city above the clouds, he is said to save a woman caught there, named Elizabeth. She is said to have the ability to change reality--a power with which her kidney wants to realise his distorted vision of the American dream.
- BioShock 2 Remastered - Experience Rapture through the eyes of Delta, a terrifying Big Daddy prototype who wants to save his lost Little Sisters. Since the events of the first BioShock part, 8 years have passed and Rapture inhabitants have teamed up into a collectivist culture. Build even more plasmid types, imagine a variety of new enemies and leave Rapture Art Deco architecture behind you to cross the seabed.
- BioShock: The Collection contains all three games in the enthusiastically recorded series - BioShock Remastered, BioShock 2 Remastered, and BioShock Infinite: The Complete Edition. Also included are all single player add-on content for all three games.
- BioShock Remastered - explore the underwater city of Rapture. What was originally designed as a refuge for the smartest minds in society, has come to a dystopian nightmare. In the flooded ruins, a new ecosystem has developed. Brainy splicers pursue the little girls, the "Little Sisters" who would be helpless without their giant Big Daddy guardians. Your survival depends on being fast, recovering weapons and using the superhuman forces with which the plasmids have changed your DNA. Because to defeat the muted monsters of Rapture, you have to become a monster yourself.
